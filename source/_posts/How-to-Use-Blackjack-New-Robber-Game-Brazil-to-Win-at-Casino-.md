#  Learn How to Play Blackjack New Brazilian Version 

In this article, we are going to teach you how to play blackjack in the new Brazilian version. This game follows the same rules as the classic blackjack game, but there are a few differences that you need to take into account. So, if you want to learn how to play blackjack like a pro and beat the casino, make sure to read on.

The first thing that you need to do is place your bets. You can bet any amount that you want, but remember that the higher your bet, the higher your chances of winning will be. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal out two cards to each player and two cards to himself. The goal of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over.

If your first two cards add up to 21 or less, you have blackjack and automatically win the hand. If your first two cards add up to more than 21, you lose automatically. If your first two cards are different (e.g. a six and a king), your second card becomes your turn card and you can choose whether to hit or stand depending on the value of this card and the dealer's face-up card.

Hit means that you want another card in order to try and get closer to 21. Stand means that you don't want any more cards and that you're happy with the total amount that you have. If your turn card is an ace and the dealer has a six or lower showing, then you can choose to double down which means doubling your bet and receiving just one more card.

If the dealer's face-up card is an ace, he will offer players insurance against blackjack. This is basically a side bet that pays out 2:1 if the dealer does have blackjack. If you don't want insurance, then decline it – but remember that if the dealer does have blackjack, then you'll lose twice what you wagered (i.e. your original bet plus the insurance bet).

So these are all of the basic rules for playing blackjack in the Brazilian version – give it a go yourself at one of our recommended casinos below!

#  How to Play Like a Pro at Blackjack New Brazilian Version 

Blackjack is a casino game that is enjoyed by many. It is one of the simplest casino games to play, and with a bit of practice you can be playing like a pro in no time at all.

In this article, we will take you through the basics of how to play blackjack so that you can start enjoying the game like a pro.

To begin with, let’s take a look at the basic rules of blackjack: 

- The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points or scoring more points than the dealer without going over 21. 
- In order to place a bet, place your chips in the betting circle in front of you. 
- Once all bets are placed, each player is dealt two cards face up. The dealer is also dealt two cards, but one card is face down. 
- The player with the highest value card starts the game and then play passes clockwise around the table. 
- In order for players to win money, their cards must have a combined total that is higher than the dealers total without going over 21. If they go over 21 they lose regardless of what their cards are. 
- In addition to normal card values (2 – 10), face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points each and an Ace can be counted as either 1 point or 11 points depending on what would be most beneficial for the player at that point in the game. 

Now that you know the basic rules of blackjack it’s time to learn how to play like a pro! The following tips will help you improve your odds at winning: 

- Always remember that the aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer not get as close to 21 as possible. This means that if your hand has a value of 16 and the dealers hand has a value of 8, you should hit (take another card) as there is a good chance that you will beat them with a final total of 24 or more. However, if your hand has a value of 18 and the dealers hand has a value of 2 then it’s best to stay (stick with your original hand). 
- In general, always take another card if your hand totals less than 12 as there is a good chance you will win with a final total of 17 or more; but always stand (stick with your original hand) if your hand totals 17 or more as it’s unlikely that taking another card will improve your chances of winning. 
- Use basic strategy charts as they provide optimal plays based on any given situation so that you never have to make complicated decisions during gameplay. You can find plenty of free charts online which are easy to print out and take with you when playing in live casinos.

When it comes to playing casino games, Blackjack has always been one of the most popular. The game is simple to play and offers plenty of chances for players to win big. Whether you’re a beginner or experienced Blackjack player, here are some tips to help you win more money when playing:

1. Know your odds

Blackjack is all about making better decisions than the dealer in order to come out ahead. One of the best ways to do this is by understanding the odds of each move you make. For example, knowing that the odds of drawing a 10 when you have an Ace are 1 in 3 will help you make better decisions when it comes to hitting or standing.

2. Use basic strategy

Another way to improve your chances of winning at Blackjack is by using basic strategy charts. These charts tell you what moves to make based on the hand you’re holding and the dealer’s upcard. By following these charts, you can minimize the house edge and increase your chances of winning.

3. Play with perfect strategy

If you really want to increase your chances of winning at Blackjack, then try playing with perfect strategy. This involves making the best decision possible for every move, based on the cards you’re holding and the dealer’s upcard. While it may take some time to learn, perfect strategy can give you a significant edge over the house.

4. Increase your bet when ahead

One way to maximize your profits when playing Blackjack is by increasing your bet when you have a good hand. This will allow you to make more money on your wins while still keeping your overall risk level low. Be careful not to overdo it, however, as there is always the chance of losing big if things go bad.
