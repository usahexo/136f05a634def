#  Florida legislators considering legalizing sports betting

The Florida Legislature is currently considering legalizing sports betting in the state, as reported by the News Service of Florida. If passed, the new law would allow licensed casinos and horse tracks to offer sports betting.

“This is about creating another source of revenue for the state,” said state Sen. Bill Galvano, a Republican from Bradenton who is sponsoring the Senate version of the bill.

The move to legalize sports betting in Florida comes as other states have already moved to do so. In May, New Jersey became the first U.S. state to allow legal sports betting following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal law prohibiting it. Delaware also began allowing sports betting last month, and West Virginia is set to follow suit this week.

Supporters of legalizing sports betting in Florida argue that it could bring in millions of dollars in new revenue for the state each year. Opponents, however, argue that it could lead to greater gambling addiction and other negative consequences.

Rep. Frank White, a Republican from Pensacola who opposes the bill, said he was worried about potential negative effects on people's lives.

"I think there's going to be more problem gamblers," White said. "I think we're going to see more broken families."

State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando who supports the bill, dismissed those concerns, arguing that they are overblown and that regulating and taxing sports betting would actually help prevent addiction problems.

"These imagined ills just don't exist," Smith said. "It's not like we're opening up a casino on every corner."

If passed, the bill would require casinos and horse tracks to pay a 15 percent tax on their gross receipts from sports betting operations. The money raised from the tax would go toward education funding in the state.

#  When will sports betting be legal in Florida?

The question of when sports betting will be legal in Florida is a difficult one to answer. The state has been slow to legalize the activity, even though there is plenty of public support for it. There are a few potential roadblocks that could prevent it from happening in the near future, but things are looking more promising than ever before. Let’s take a closer look at the current situation and what might happen in the coming months.

One of the main issues preventing sports betting from becoming legal in Florida is the fact that it is currently illegal on a federal level. The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, was passed back in 1992 and prohibits any form of sports betting except for in a few specific states. This law is now being challenged by several different entities, including the state of New Jersey, so it’s possible that it will eventually be overturned. If that happens, then Florida would be free to legalize sports betting without any issues.

Another potential obstacle is the fact that there are already several casinos operating in Florida. The state has been hesitant to license any new casinos, so it’s possible that they won’t want to open up the market for sports betting as well. However, there is some discussion about allowing existing casinos to offer sports betting, which would help to speed up the process.

At this point, it seems likely that sports betting will be legalized in Florida within the next year or two. The state has shown interest in joining New Jersey in their legal challenge against PASPA, and there have been some positive movements on the legislative front as well. With public support high and casinos eager to get involved,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) it looks like things are finally moving in the right direction.

#  What's taking Florida so long to legalize sports betting?

It was only a matter of time before Florida legislators would legalize sports betting in the state, but the process is taking longer than many had anticipated. The holdup seems to be largely over who will be able to operate sportsbooks in the state, with casino operators at odds with one another over who should have exclusivity.

Advocates of legalizing sports betting say that it would provide a new stream of revenue for the state, and there is some evidence that this is true. In other states where sports betting has been legalized, tax revenue from the activity has exceeded initial estimates. Casinos and racetracks argue that they are best placed to operate sportsbooks, while others maintain that online gaming companies should be given a chance to get into the market as well.

At the moment, it's unclear how things will shake out in Florida, but it's likely that some form of sports betting will eventually be legalized in the state. In the meantime, gamblers are continuing to place their bets illegally, which can lead to problems since these bets are not subject to any sort of regulation.

#  Sports betting could be coming to Florida casinos

 Florida lawmakers are considering a measure that would legalize sports betting in the state's casinos. The proposed bill would allow bets to be placed on professional and collegiate sporting events.

The move could bring in millions of dollars in additional revenue for the state, as well as create new jobs in the casino industry. Casino operators are hopeful that the bill will be approved, as it would give them a new way to attract customers to their properties.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other problems. However, supporters maintain that sports betting can be done in a responsible manner and that it would provide a new source of revenue for the state.

It remains to be seen whether the bill will be approved, but if it is, it could lead to major changes in the gambling landscape in Florida.

#  Legal Sports Betting May Finally Come to Florida in 2019

Gamblers in the Sunshine State may finally get to bet on their favorite sports teams legally in 2019.

On January 9, 2019, Florida state Senator Bill Galvano announced a proposed bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The proposed bill would allow sports betting both at casinos and through mobile apps.

This is great news for Florida gamblers, who have been looking for a way to legally bet on sports since 2011, when the federal government banned sports betting with the passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act.

That law made it illegal for banks and other financial institutions to process payments for online gambling websites. As a result, most online gambling websites stopped accepting customers from the United States.

Since then, several states have legalized some form of sports betting. In 2018, New Jersey became the first state to allow sports betting outside of Nevada. Delaware, Mississippi, and West Virginia also now allow some form of legal sports betting.

It is unclear how much opposition the proposed bill will face in the Florida legislature. Some lawmakers may be reluctant to legalize gambling after seeing the negative effects that casino gambling has had in other states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

Others may argue that legalizing sports betting could help boost tourism in Florida, especially since it would be one of the few states to offer legal mobile betting apps. In addition, the proposed bill would allow Floridians to gamble on college and professional sporting events, something they are not currently able to do.

If passed, the proposed bill would give Florida residents another option for spending their entertainment dollars and could help generate additional tax revenue for the state.
