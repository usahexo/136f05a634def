#  Why is Where Genesis Casino named as it is? 

When it comes to casino sites, the name of the game is usually all about giving players a taste of what they can expect when they sign up. For some reason, the team at Genesis Casino clearly felt that this was something worth putting some extra effort into, as the site’s name is not just a random selection. 

In fact, if you take a closer look at the name, you will see that it is actually made up of two parts. The first half is ‘Genesis’, which refers to the beginning of everything. This could not be more fitting for a casino site, as gambling itself has been around for centuries and predates modern civilization. 

The second half of the name, ‘Casino’, is equally as important. It serves as a reminder that this is a place where players can come and enjoy themselves in a safe and secure environment. In other words, it is a place where everyone can feel like a VIP!
