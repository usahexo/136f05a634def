#  Hollywood Casino Going All-In on Poker Table

 ## Hollywood Casino, one of Pennsylvania's largest and most popular casinos, is expanding its gaming options by adding poker tables to its floor plan.

The move is part of a larger effort by the casino to capitalize on the growing popularity of poker in the United States. According to industry experts, poker is one of the few forms of gambling that is seeing steady growth, even as other segments of the market stagnate.

In response to this trend, Hollywood Casino has decided to add 15 new poker tables to its floor. This will bring the total number of poker tables at the casino up to 30, making it one of the largest poker destinations in Pennsylvania.

The new poker area will be situated in close proximity to the casino's existing sports book. This will give players easy access to both gambling options and allow them to switch back and forth between different games as they see fit.

Hollywood Casino isn't the only casino in Pennsylvania making moves in anticipation of increased demand for poker. In fact, just this week another casino in the state announced that it was doubling its number of poker tables.

So what's driving all this interest in poker? One major factor is that the game has seen a surge in popularity on television. Shows like "Poker Night In America" and "World Poker Tour" have helped make the game more mainstream and attract new players.

Another factor is that online gambling sites have made it easier than ever for people to get into the game. You can now play poker from your computer or phone any time you want, without having to leave your home. This has made it possible for people who wouldn't normally have access to a casino gaming environment to experience the thrill of playing high stakes poker.

Whatever the reason, it's clear that interest in poker is on the rise and Hollywood Casino is doing its best to capitalize on that trend. If you're looking for a place to play some serious Texas Hold 'Em, then Hollywood Casino should definitely be on your radar.

The Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana is in the midst of a $5 million renovation that will see its poker room undergo a major transformation. The work is scheduled for completion in time for the World Series of Poker (WSOP) which begins on May 28.

The existing poker room will be replaced by a new 16-table poker area that will be open 24 hours a day. The remodeling will also include a new bar and lounge area, and an extended non-smoking section.

“This is honestly one of the most exciting things we’ve done since we opened,” said Kalen Ascione, director of casino operations at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg. “We are completely transforming our poker room into something that is really top-notch and unique to the market.”

The WSOP is returning to Indianapolis this year after a two-year absence, and Hollywood Casino plans to make the most of it. In addition to the new poker room, the casino will also offer betting on the event itself as well as an extensive range of promotional activities.

“This is an incredibly important time for us, as we gears up for the WSOP and look to attract even more players to our property,” Ascione said.
