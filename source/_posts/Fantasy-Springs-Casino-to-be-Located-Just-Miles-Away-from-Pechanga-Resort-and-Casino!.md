#  Pechanga Resort and Casino to Expand After Acquisition of Fantasy Springs Resort Casino

The Pechanga Resort and Casino announced that it will be expanding its operations after the acquisition of the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino. The $267 million acquisition will add a 350-room hotel, a convention center, additional restaurants and gaming space to the Pechanga Resort and Casino.

“This is an important day in the history of Pechanga as we continue on our path of growth and exceptional guest service. With this expansion, we are not only able to offer more amenities and space for our guests, but also create jobs and economic opportunities throughout Southern California,” said Chairman Mark Macarro of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians.

According to estimates by the tribe, the expansion is expected to create 1,000 construction jobs and 2,500 permanent jobs. In addition, the expansion is expected to generate more than $300 million in economic activity each year.

The Fantasy Springs Resort Casino was founded in 2002 by the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians. The casino has 2,000 slot machines, 44 table games and a hotel with 204 rooms.

#  Fantasy Springs Casino will Cause Job Losses for Pechanga Employees 

The development of the $250 million Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California is likely to cause job losses for employees at the nearby Pechanga Resort and Casino.

According to a study conducted by The National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA), the construction and operation of the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino is expected to result in the loss of 1,500 jobs at the Pechanga Resort and Casino.

The NIGA study also found that the development of the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino will have a significant impact on tribal casinos nationwide, resulting in the loss of more than 11,000 jobs.

“This study confirms what we have been saying for some time now - that tribal gaming is under significant threat from large commercial casino developments like Fantasy Springs,” said NIGA Chairman Ernie Stevens Jr. “We urge state and federal officials to take note of these findings and take action to ensure that tribal gaming is protected.”

The Fantasy Springs Resort Casino is expected to open in late 2016.

#  Pechanga's Acquisition of Fantasy Springs Resort Casino Could Signal the End for Other Smaller Casinos in the Region

The recent acquisition of Fantasy Springs Resort Casino by Pechanga Resort and Casino could signal the end for other smaller casinos in the region.

Pechanga's purchase of Fantasy Springs, a 202-acre resort casino located in Indio, California, comes as no surprise. The two resorts are located just a few miles from each other and share the same customer base.

Fantasy Springs is one of the smallest casinos in the region, with just 1,500 slot machines. It has long been overshadowed by Pechanga, which has more than 4,500 slot machines.

With Pechanga's acquisition of Fantasy Springs, there are now just a handful of small casinos remaining in southern California. These casinos may not be able to compete with the larger resorts and could be forced to close down.
