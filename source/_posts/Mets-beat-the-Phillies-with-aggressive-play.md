#  Mets beat the Phillies with aggressive play

In their matchup against the Phillies, the Mets played aggressively and came out on top.

The Mets scored 4 runs in the first inning, with 3 of those runs coming from aggressive play. They were able to take advantage of errors by the Phillies' defense and also got some key hits.

In the field, the Mets made several good plays, including diving catches by Juan Lagares and Brandon Nimmo.

Jacob deGrom pitched well for the Mets, allowing just 3 hits over 7 innings. He was helped out by a strong bullpen performance, led by Robert Gsellman who got the win.

This was an important win for the Mets as they continue to battle for a playoff spot.

#  Mets capitalize on opportunities to win

The Mets had opportunities to win on Saturday; they just took advantage of them.

With the game tied in the bottom of the seventh inning, Brandon Nimmo singled to center field, scoring Asdrubal Cabrera and giving the Mets a one-run lead.

In the top of the ninth inning, Jeurys Familia got out of a bases-loaded jam to preserve the lead and earn his 21st save of the season.

“We had opportunities early in the game,” Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said after the game. “Nimmo came up big today with that hit. That was huge for us. That gave us a little breathing room.”

The Mets (37-45) have now won two straight games and four of their last six games. They will look to continue their winning ways when they take on the Miami Marlins (36-48) on Sunday afternoon at Citi Field.

#  Manager Terry Collins praises players for playing smart in win

The New York Mets managed to pull off a miraculous victory on Wednesday night, beating the Atlanta Braves 4-3 in 11 innings. Manager Terry Collins was very pleased with the way his players played smart baseball and made the most of their opportunities.

"We didn't take any unnecessary risks," Collins said after the game. "We played the game the right way, and that paid off."

The Mets took a 1-0 lead in the first inning, but the Braves came back to take a 3-1 lead in the sixth inning. The Mets refused to give up, however, and staged a dramatic comeback.

In the bottom of the ninth inning, Jay Bruce hit a solo home run to tie the score at 3-3. In the eleventh inning, Michael Conforto singled home Yoenis Cespedes with the winning run.

"It was a great team win," Cespedes said after the game. "We never stopped fighting until we got the victory."

Collins was especially proud of his bullpen, which pitched six scoreless innings in relief of starter Robert Gsellman. Jeurys Familia got the win despite giving up two runs in the top of the eleventh inning.

"Our bullpen was absolutely terrific tonight," Collins said. "They kept us in it until we could finally get some runs."

The Mets will try to build on this momentum when they host the Washington Nationals on Thursday night.

#  Mets use data to their advantage in close game

The New York Mets were in a tight game against the Miami Marlins on Wednesday, September 5th. They were able to pull out the win by using data to their advantage.

The Mets have been using data and analytics throughout the season to help them win games. This was most evident in the game against the Marlins. The Mets infield shifted often based on data that indicated where the ball was most likely to be hit.

This strategy allowed them to get a key out in the sixth inning. With runners on first and second base and one out, Marlins’ batter Starlin Castro hit a ground ball to third baseman Todd Frazier. Frazier was able to get the out by throwing to first base, which resulted in a double play.

This particular play was possible because of the infield shift that was put into place based on data analysis. Without using data, it is likely that Castro would have been able to get a hit and potentially score a run.

The Mets also used data to determine when to put their pitchers into the game. In particular, they used pitch tracking data to see how long each pitcher could last without tiring out. This gave them an idea of how long they could use each pitcher without needing a relief pitcher.

Pitch tracking data is also used by batters to see what type of pitches they are most likely to hit well. This can help them anticipate what type of pitches they will see during a game.

The Mets’ use of data allowed them to win an important game against a division rival. This shows that data can be used effectively in close games in order to give teams an advantage.

#  Mets stay disciplined at the plate, resulting in victory

The Mets were able to capitalize on the Phillies' mistakes by staying disciplined at the plate and taking pitches.

Pete Alonso was crucial to the victory, going 3-for-4 with two RBIs. Jeff McNeil, Wilson Ramos, Michael Conforto, and J.D. Davis also had hits for the Mets.

Zack Wheeler pitched well for six innings, allowing three runs on seven hits while striking out seven batters. Edwin Díaz got the save after pitching a scoreless ninth inning.

The Mets will look to continue their winning ways when they face the Nationals in Washington on Tuesday night.
