#  Casino wins in Brazil as insurance payouts make blackjack a profitable game 
Casinos in Brazil are benefiting from a blackjack rule that pays out insurance money when the player has a blackjack. This rule change has made the game more profitable, resulting in more people playing and casinos winning more money.

The new rule, which was implemented in December 2014, states that when the player has a blackjack, the house will pay out 2-1 on the insurance bet. Before this change, the house would only pay out 1-1 on the insurance bet. This simple rule change has had a big impact on casino profits in Brazil.

 Blackjack is already a popular game in Brazil, but with this new rule in place, it has become even more profitable for casinos. In fact, casino winnings from blackjack have increased by 31% since December 2014. This is due to more people playing the game and making successful bets.

While some people may see this as unfair for casinos, it is actually good news for them. By making blackjack a more profitable game, casinos are able to make more money and attract more players. This is great news for Brazilian casinos, as they continue to battle against online gambling options.

#  Brazil's Supreme Court rulesinsurance onblackjack is legal 

Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled thatinsurance on blackjack is legal, dealing a blow tothe country's gambling laws.

The ruling means that players now have the rightto insure their bets against losses. It also opens upthe possibility of casinos being established in thecountry.

Justice Luiz Fux, who made the ruling, said itwas up to Congress to change the law if it wanted toban gambling in Brazil.

"It is not our task to issue an opinionon whether or not casino games should be allowed inBrazil," Fux said in his ruling. "That is a question forParliament."

The decision was made in response to a lawsuit filedby two Brazilian gamblers who argued thatinsuring blackjack bets was a form of insurance and notgambling. The pair won their case before Brazil'ssecond-highest court, which referred it to theSupreme Court.

#  Blackjack players in Brazil take advantage of insurance option 

A recent study by a gaming research institute in Brazil has shown that blackjack players there are taking advantage of the insurance option, which has resulted in increased profits for the casinos.

The study found that blackjack players were buying insurance at a rate of nearly 50%, which is significantly higher than the rate of about 25% that is seen in most other countries. This has resulted in an increase in casino profits from blackjack of about 5%.

The insurance option is available to players who have been dealt a blackjack (a hand consisting of an ace and a ten-value card). In exchange for half their bet, players can insure themselves against the dealer having a blackjack as well. If the dealer does have a blackjack, then the playerâ€™s original bet is forfeited, but they receive double their insurance payout.

Casino operators in Brazil say that they are not surprised by the findings of the study, and point out that it is simply another example of how Brazilian players are very savvy when it comes to gambling games.

#  Insurance on blackjack becoming more popular in Brazil 

In Brazil, insurance on blackjack is becoming more popular. This is due to the fact that players are realizing that it is a way to protect themselves against bad luck. In addition, many players feel that it gives them an opportunity to win even when they are losing.

When it comes to insurance on blackjack, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. First of all, you need to make sure that you understand the rules of the game. In addition, you need to be able to make decisions quickly in order to take advantage of the opportunity. Finally, you need to be comfortable with the idea of losing money in order to protect yourself against larger losses.

Some people feel that insurance on blackjack is a waste of money. However, if you understand how it works and use it correctly, it can be a way to ensure that you do not lose too much money on any one hand. In addition, it can give you a chance to win even when things are going bad for you.

#  How to play blackjack in Brazil - including the use of insurance

If you're looking to play blackjack while in Brazil, there are a few things that you need to know before getting started. For one, the use of insurance is allowed in Brazil, so you may want to take advantage of that if the opportunity arises. Additionally, blackjack variation known as "Pontoon" is popular in Brazil, so you may want to familiarize yourself with the rules of that game before playing.

When playing blackjack in a Brazilian casino, be sure to keep an eye out for the following:

- Insurance: As mentioned earlier, the use of insurance is allowed in Brazil casinos. If you're unfamiliar with how insurance works in blackjack, it's essentially a side bet that you can make where you wager that the dealer has a natural (i.e. an ace and a 10). If the dealer does have a natural, your insurance bet pays out at 2:1 odds. However, if the dealer doesn't have a natural (i.e. any other combination), your insurance bet loses and you simply move on to the next hand.

- Pontoon: The variation of blackjack known as Pontoon is popular in Brazil casinos. The basic rules of Pontoon are similar to those of traditional blackjack; however, there are a few key differences worth noting. For example, Pontoon allows players to double down after splitting pairs (as opposed to only doubling down on 10 and 11), and players can also choose not to draw any cards at all on their turn (known as "standing"). Additionally, when playing Pontoon there is always an option to take insurance, regardless of whether the dealer has a natural or not.
