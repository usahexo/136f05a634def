#  AS Roma look to maintain unbeaten run against Napoli 

Roma travel to the San Paolo on Saturday night looking to maintain their unbeaten start to the season against Napoli. The Partenopei have started the season poorly, and currently sit in 12th place in the table, but they will be no easy opponent for Eusebio Di Francesco’s side.

Napoli have a good record against Roma in recent years, and have only lost one of the last six meetings between the two sides. However, Roma come into this match in good form, having won their last three games in all competitions.

The main threat for Roma is likely to come from Dries Mertens. The Belgian striker has been in excellent form this season, scoring nine goals in all competitions so far. He will be hoping to add to his tally against Roma and help Napoli get back to winning ways.

Roma will be without right-back Rick Karsdorp due to injury, but they otherwise have a full squad available for selection. Napoli are missing Faouzi Ghoulam due to injury, but otherwise have a fully fit squad.

It should be an exciting game between two sides who like to play attacking football. Napoli will be looking to get back to winning ways, while Roma will be looking to continue their good start to the season.

#  AS Roma keen to avenge last season's home defeat to Napoli 

Roma are looking to avenge their home defeat to Napoli from last season when the two sides meet again at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday.

Both teams have had a mixed start to the season, with Roma picking up seven points from their opening four games, while Napoli have registered six points from four matches.

One of the main factors in Roma's downfall against Napoli last season was the lack of contribution from their star player, Mohamed Salah. The Egyptian winger was unable to make an impact on the game and was eventually substituted in the second half.

However, Salah has now had a full pre-season with Roma and has looked sharp in their opening fixtures. He will be looking to score his first goal against Napoli and help Roma secure all three points on Saturday.

Napoli's main threats come in the form of forwards Lorenzo Insigne and Dries Mertens. The duo have scored five goals between them so far this season, and will be looking to add to that tally against Roma.

Roma head coach Eusebio Di Francesco is confident that his side can get a positive result against Napoli this weekend. "I expect an intense match against a very difficult opponent," said Di Francesco. "But we're hungry for success and we want to win." 

Predicted line-ups: 

Roma: Alisson; Florenzi, Manolas, Fazio, Kolarov; Pellegrini, De Rossi, Nainggolan; Perotti, Dzeko, Salah 
Napoli: Reina; Hysaj, Albiol, Koulibaly, Ghoulam; Allan, Jorginho, Hamšík; Callejón, Mertens, Insigne

#  Napoli look to build on Champions League success with victory over Roma 

Napoli will be looking to build on their impressive Champions League win over Liverpool when they take on Roma in Serie A on Saturday.

The Partenopei produced a superb attacking performance to record a 5-0 victory over the Reds at Anfield, and they will be hoping to continue their good form against Roma.

Roma are currently second in the table, four points behind leaders Juventus, so Napoli know that they will need to be at their best if they are to take all three points from this match.

Carlo Ancelotti's side have been in excellent form in the league this season, with only one defeat in 17 matches, and they will be confident of getting a positive result against Roma on Saturday.

Ancelotti is likely to stick with the same team that beat Liverpool in the Champions League, with Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne both likely to start up front.

Roma have had an inconsistent season so far and they may struggle against Napoli's attack-minded players. Eusebio Di Francesco's side have only won two of their last six matches in all competitions, so they may not be able to match Napoli on Saturday.

#  Could this be the match that decides the title race? 

Manchester City welcome Liverpool to the Etihad Stadium on Thursday night, in a match that could be crucial in deciding the Premier League title race.

Both teams head into the fixture in excellent form, with City having won their last nine league games and Liverpool eight in a row.

Pep Guardiola's side currently sit two points clear of Liverpool at the top of the table, but a win for Jurgen Klopp's men would see them move level on points and put pressure on City to keep winning.



Liverpool were victorious when the sides met earlier in the season, with Sadio Mane scoring the only goal of the game at Anfield. However, City will be confident of avenging that defeat and moving one step closer to defending their Premier League crown.

#  AS Roma and Napoli prepare for battle in the Eternal City

The Stadio Olimpico will be packed and bouncing on Saturday night as AS Roma and Napoli face off in what is arguably the biggest game of the Serie A season so far.

Both teams come into the match in good form, with Roma 4th in the table and Napoli just a point behind them in 5th.

Roma have been scoring goals for fun this season, with Brazilian winger Diego Perotti being their main man, having already scored 7 goals this campaign. However, they will be up against a solid Napoli defense that has only conceded 10 goals in 16 games so far.

Napoli have been relying heavily on striker Lorenzo Insigne, who has already scored 9 goals this season. They will also need to watch out for Edin Dzeko, who has been in excellent goal-scoring form recently and has 5 goals in his last 7 games.

This is shaping up to be a truly epic battle between two of Italy’s biggest clubs, and it is sure to be a thriller from start to finish.
