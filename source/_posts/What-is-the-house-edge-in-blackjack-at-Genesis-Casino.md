#  What is the house edge in blackjack at Genesis Casino?

When it comes to the house edge in blackjack at Genesis Casino, this varies depending on the variant that you choose to play. However, for most variants the house edge is between 0.5% and 1%. This means that for every $100 that you wager, you can expect to lose between 50 cents and $1.

Some variants have a lower house edge, while others have a higher edge. For example, blackjack switch has a house edge of 2%, while Spanish 21 has a house edge of just 0.2%. So if you’re looking for a game with a lower risk, then Spanish 21 is a good option.

However, it’s important to remember that no game is completely risk free, so you should always gamble responsibly. Even with games that have a low house edge, there’s always the potential to lose money if you’re not careful. So make sure you only gamble what you can afford to lose, and never try to chase your losses.

#  What are the rules for blackjack at Genesis Casino?

Players can enjoy blackjack at Genesis Casino with a few simple rules. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. A player's first two cards are combined together to make their initial hand, and they must then choose whether to hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they've got). If they reach 21, they win automatically - regardless of what the dealer has.

If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose instantly. In addition, if the dealer has an ace and a card with a value of 10 (a blackjack), they automatically win - unless the player has a blackjack too, in which case it's a draw.

There are a number of different betting options available in blackjack, which players can learn more about by checking out the casino's guide. For example, players can place side bets on things like whether their first two cards will be paired up or not.
