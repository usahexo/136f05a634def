#  Phil Mickelson Loses $1 Million in Gambling

Phil Mickelson has lost a staggering $1 million in high-stakes gambling over the last two years, according to a new report.

The 46-year-old golfer has been playing in private poker and blackjack games with wealthy businessmen and fellow professional athletes, and has lost big on a number of occasions.

"He's got a bit of a gambling problem," one source told ESPN. "He's lost millions in recent years."

Mickelson's wife, Amy, is said to be well aware of her husband's gambling addiction, and has even accompanied him to some of the high-stakes games.

In 2010, Mickelson won more than $10 million from tournaments around the world, but his losses at the casino tables appear to have more than offset those winnings.

It's not clear how much money he has lost in total, but reports suggest that it could be as much as $15 million.

Mickelson is one of the richest athletes in the world, with an estimated net worth of $180 million. However, his losses at the poker table are starting to take their toll.

Earlier this year, he was forced to sell some of his prized possessions - including a rare collection of golf memorabilia - to help pay off his debts.

#  Phil Mickelson Loses Another $1 Million in Gambling

Phil Mickelson has had a long history with gambling. This week, he lost another $1 million in a high stakes poker game.

It's been well documented that Mickelson has a serious gambling problem. He's even admitted to it himself. In fact, he's lost over $40 million in gambling since 1989.

This latest loss is just another blemish on an already disappointing year for Mickelson. He failed to win a single tournament in 2017 and currently sits at number 15 in the world rankings.

#  Phil Mickelson Loses $10 Million in Gambling

Phil Mickelson has spoken out about his $10 million gambling loss to Ted Forrest in a series of interviews this week. The losses occurred over the course of three years, and Mickelson insists that he has learned his lesson and will not be gambling any money he can't afford to lose in the future.

While some people may see this as a personal failing, Mickelson is adamant that it was simply a case of bad luck. "I had a stretch where I just didn't play well," he said in an interview with ESPN. "I was trying to grind it out and make cuts, and I just wasn't doing well."

Mickelson is certainly not the only professional golfer to suffer from a gambling addiction; Tiger Woods has admitted to losing millions of dollars over the years due to his habit. However, Mickelson is one of the few athletes who has been open about his struggles and is willing to talk about them in public.

This is not the first time that Mickelson has had to deal with personal problems outside of golf. In 2009, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent surgery to remove the tumor. He later announced that he was cancer-free.

Despite his recent losses, Mickelson remains one of the most successful golfers in history. He has won five major championships and 43 PGA Tour events. He is also one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, with career earnings totaling more than $80 million.

#  Phil Mickelson's Gambling Problem Costs Him Millions

Phil Mickelson has had a problem with gambling for years, and it finally caught up to him.

According to reports, Mickelson owed millions of dollars to several different casinos. In an effort to pay off his debts, he recently agreed to forfeit nearly $1 million that he won at the U.S. Open.

This is not the first time that Mickelson has been in trouble because of his gambling habit. In 2013, he was fined by the PGA Tour after admitting that he had used insider information to make money on a bet.

In a statement released earlier this week, Mickelson said that he is "embarrassed and disappointed" by his actions. He also said that he plans to "fully cooperate" with the investigation into his gambling habits.

While some people are quick to judge Mickelson for his troubles, it's important to remember that gambling addiction is a real and serious problem. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, nearly two million Americans are addicted to gambling.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. The National Council on Problem Gambling provides resources and support for people who need help dealing with this issue.

#  Phil Mickelson's Losses From Gambling Total in the Millions

Gambling is a popular pastime for many people, but for professional athletes, it can be a costly distraction. Phil Mickelson is a great example of this.

Mickelson has publicly admitted to losing millions of dollars from gambling over the years. In fact, one estimate puts his losses at around $60 million. This doesn't include the money he's spent on gambling debts and fines levied against him by casinos.

Why does Mickelson continue to gamble despite these losses? It's unclear, but it's likely a combination of factors, including the thrill of the game and the rush of winning money.

Whatever the reason, Mickelson's losses have taken a toll on his career. He has openly talked about how his gambling habit has affected his performance on the golf course. For example, in 2010 he missed the cut at The Masters after admitting that he had gambled heavily in the days leading up to the tournament.

Despite his losses, Mickelson has said that he has no plans to stop gambling. In fact, he seems to be doubling down on his bets in recent years. In May 2017 he lost $2 million playing high-stakes poker against some of the world's best players.

It will be interesting to see how Mickelson's gambling habit affects his future in golf. So far, it hasn't stopped him from winning tournaments or earning millions of dollars in prize money. But at some point, his losses are likely to catch up with him.
