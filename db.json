is the Design Moldova 2022 Committee","date":"2022-08-11T08:48:51.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What is the Design Moldova 2022 Committee?\n\nThe Design Moldova 2022 Committee is a government-funded committee that was established in 2020 with the goal of promoting the design industry in Moldova and attracting foreign investors to the country. The committee is also responsible for organizing the Moldova Design Week, a major design festival that takes place every two years.\n\nDesign Moldova 2022 is chaired by Adrian Ceban, the Minister of Economy of Moldova. The other members of the committee include representatives from the private sector, academia, and the government.\n\nThe committee has made significant progress in promoting the design industry in Moldova. In 2020, they organized the first-ever Moldova Design Week, which featured exhibitions, conferences, and workshops from designers from all over the world. The event was a huge success and attracted more than 10,000 visitors.\n\nThe committee is also working to attract foreign investors to Moldova. In 2020, they partnered with several major companies, including Vitra and Samsung, to hold exhibitions and workshops during the Moldova Design Week. These events provided businesses with an opportunity to learn more about the design industry in Moldova and explore investment opportunities in the country.\n\n#  What is the theme of the exhibition?\n\nThe theme of the exhibition is technology and its impact on the world. The exhibition will explore how technology has changed over time, the different ways it has been used and how it has shaped the world we live in today. It will also look at the future of technology and what we can expect from it.\n\n# What are some of the highlights of the exhibition?\n\nSome of the highlights of the exhibition include a replica of Gutenberg's printing press, an early telephone, a robot and a 3D printer.
