        <h1 id="What-is-the-meaning-of-Big-Panda"><a href="#What-is-the-meaning-of-Big-Panda" class="headerlink" title="What is the meaning of Big Panda?"></a>What is the meaning of Big Panda?</h1><p>There is no one definitive meaning of the term Big Panda, as it is used to describe a variety of different things. Generally speaking, however, it refers to anything that is large and impressive. For example, a person might call a particularly large and muscular person a “Big Panda.” Alternatively, something could be called the “Big Panda” if it is the largest or most impressive example of its kind.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-origin-of-Big-Panda"><a href="#What-is-the-origin-of-Big-Panda" class="headerlink" title="What is the origin of Big Panda?"></a>What is the origin of Big Panda?</h1><p>There is much debate as to the true origin of the big panda. Some scientists believe it is purely a product of nature, while others insist man has had a hand in their development. The first recorded big panda was discovered in 1869 by French missionary Armand David in the province of Sichuan, China. He obtained a skin and skull from a hunter and subsequently sent them to the Paris Museum of Natural History. At that time, panda skins were highly sought after by Westerners as wall hangings and rugs.</p>
<p>In 1888, an American naturalist named Dr. Walter Rothschild purchased a live specimen from a hunter for $500 and brought it back to England. He later donated it to the London Zoo, where it lived until its death in 1918. These early specimens were all considered black and white pandas, since brown furred individuals had not yet been sighted.</p>
<p>In 1929, Dr. Theodore Studer became the first person to photograph a live wild panda in western Sichuan. About the same time, explorers started finding skins and skulls with distinctive reddish markings in remote parts of western Sichuan and eastern Tibet. In 1936, these discoveries led to the formal description of a new species, Ailuropoda melanoleuca melanoleuca (black-and-white giant panda).</p>
<p>However, some scientists contend that even these early specimens may have been hybrids between black-and-white giant pandas and red pandas, which are much smaller (about the size of a domestic cat) and have different physical characteristics. They suggest that natural selection may have eventually resulted in the present day form of Ailuropoda melanoleuca (commonly known as big panda). Others believe that man has played a role in their development, crossing black-and-white giant pandas with red pandas to produce offspring with intermediate coloration. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this hypothesis.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-function-of-Big-Panda"><a href="#What-is-the-function-of-Big-Panda" class="headerlink" title="What is the function of Big Panda?"></a>What is the function of Big Panda?</h1><p>The Chinese company known as Big Panda was founded in 2014, and its primary function is to offer digital marketing services to its clients. These services include SEO, social media marketing, and online reputation management.</p>
<p>Big Panda has been very successful in China, where it is one of the leading digital marketing agencies. It has also been expanding rapidly into other countries, including the United States.</p>
<p>One of the things that has made Big Panda so successful is its focus on providing excellent customer service. The company has a very experienced team of digital marketers who are highly dedicated to their clients’ success.</p>
<p>Big Panda is also constantly innovating and expanding its services to meet the needs of its clients. For example, it recently launched a new service called “Panda 360” which offers complete online marketing solutions for businesses.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-versions-of-Big-Panda-are-there"><a href="#How-many-versions-of-Big-Panda-are-there" class="headerlink" title="How many versions of Big Panda are there?"></a>How many versions of Big Panda are there?</h1><p>There are a few different versions of the Big Panda mascot. There’s the traditional one with the black and white fur, and then there are some newer designs with different colors. As for how many versions there are in total, it’s hard to say for sure. But between all of the different designs, there are probably at least a few dozen.</p>
<p>The original Big Panda was created in 1955 by Japanese artist Tatsuo Horiuchi. He was working for a Japanese advertising agency at the time, and they were looking for a new character to promote a new type of bread. Horiuchi came up with the idea for Big Panda, and the character quickly became popular.</p>
<p>Since then, Big Panda has been used in all sorts of marketing materials and products. In recent years, he’s even started appearing in video games and other forms of media. And as his popularity has continued to grow, so too has the variety of designs available for him.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a cool and unique mascot to represent your company or product, big panda is definitely worth considering. He’s cute, memorable, and sure to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-difference-between-Big-Panda-and-other-similar-games"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-Big-Panda-and-other-similar-games" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between Big Panda and other similar games?"></a>What is the difference between Big Panda and other similar games?</h1><p>Most of the big panda games out there are match three games. You need to connect at least three panda items of the same kind to make them disappear. Once all pandas have vanished, you’ve cleared that particular level.</p>
<p>In most cases, you will also come across special objects which can help or hinder your progress. For example, sometimes you will need to use a bomb to clear away an obstacle. However, you can only carry a limited number of these bombs with you, so you need to use them sparingly.</p>
<p>There are also jigsaw puzzle type games in which you need to re-create a particular picture by clicking on different tiles. The faster you complete the puzzle, the more points you earn.</p>
<p>The aim of big panda is always to clear the level as quickly as possible and to achieve as high a score as possible.</p>
