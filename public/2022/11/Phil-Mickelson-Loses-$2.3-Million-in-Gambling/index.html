        <h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Loses-2-3-Million-in-Gambling"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Loses-2-3-Million-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Loses $2.3 Million in Gambling"></a>Phil Mickelson Loses $2.3 Million in Gambling</h1><p>Phil Mickelson, one of the most successful golfers in history, may have to start winning tournaments again to make up for a major gambling loss.</p>
<p>According to reports, Mickelson lost $2.3 million in two days at a casino in Las Vegas. This comes as a major blow to the golfer, who is already dealing with a swing change and some poor play this year.</p>
<p>Mickelson has never been shy about his love of gambling, but this loss is likely his biggest ever. In fact, it may be enough to put a dent in his net worth, which is estimated at over $100 million.</p>
<p>In the past, Mickelson has joked about his casino losses, saying “I’m not opposed to blowing my entire bankroll.” But it’s clear that he’s taking this recent defeat seriously.</p>
<p>Mickelson is scheduled to play in the upcoming PGA Championship and he’ll surely be looking to make up for his recent losses. He’ll also need a good performance if he wants to keep his spot on the Ryder Cup team.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Loses-Record-8-Million-in-Gambling"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Loses-Record-8-Million-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Loses Record $8 Million in Gambling"></a>Phil Mickelson Loses Record $8 Million in Gambling</h1><p>Gambling can be a dangerous game – even when you’re as successful as Phil Mickelson. The popular professional golfer made headlines recently when it was revealed that he had lost a staggering $8 million in just one day at a casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Mickelson is no stranger to gambling; he has famously bet on himself to win tournaments in the past. But this latest loss is said to be the biggest single gambling loss ever suffered by a professional athlete.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old was playing blackjack at the high stakes tables at the luxurious Bellagio casino when he lost the money. Reportedly, Mickelson was up against some of the biggest names in gambling, including well-known poker player Andy Beal.</p>
<p>When asked about his losses, Mickelson merely shrugged and said “I gambled and I lost.” He also insisted that he doesn’t have a problem with gambling and that it’s something he enjoys doing in his spare time.</p>
<p>Mickelson is currently ranked fifth on Forbes’ list of top earning golfers, with estimated annual earnings of $43 million. So losing $8 million in a single day is definitely not something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>In fact, some are already speculating that this latest debacle could have a negative impact on Mickelson’s career and sponsorships going forward. It will be interesting to see how he recovers from this costly mistake – both financially and reputationally.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Loses-Another-1-Million-in-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Loses-Another-1-Million-in-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Loses Another $1 Million in Casino Gambling"></a>Phil Mickelson Loses Another $1 Million in Casino Gambling</h1><p>Phil Mickelson’s gambling addiction continues to cost him dearly. The five-time major winner lost another $1 million in casino gambling in the last two months, according to reports.</p>
<p>Mickelson has been open about his struggles with gambling and how it has negatively impacted his life. “It’s been a fight,” he said in February. “It’s been a battle.”</p>
<p>In addition to the money he’s lost at casinos, Mickelson has also had to pay millions of dollars in fines and settlements related to his gambling. In 2017, he agreed to forfeit $1 million as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission after being caught up in an insider trading scandal.</p>
<p>Despite his ongoing troubles with gambling, Mickelson has refused to give up playing cards and blackjack at casinos. “I’m not going to stop,” he said in February. “I love the game too much.”</p>
<p>Mickelson’s latest losses come just a few weeks after he finished runner-up at the Masters, one of golf’s biggest tournaments. It’s unclear if his casino losses played any role in his performance at Augusta National Golf Club, but it’s clear that Phil Mickelson still has a lot of work to do when it comes to his gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson’s-Massive-Losses-at-the-Casino-Nearly-5-Million-in-2-Days"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson’s-Massive-Losses-at-the-Casino-Nearly-5-Million-in-2-Days" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson’s Massive Losses at the Casino: Nearly $5 Million in 2 Days"></a>Phil Mickelson’s Massive Losses at the Casino: Nearly $5 Million in 2 Days</h1><p>It’s been a costly weekend for Phil Mickelson. The golfer has lost nearly $5 million in just two days at the casino.</p>
<p>On Friday, Mickelson dropped $2.7 million at the Bellagio resort in Las Vegas. And on Saturday, he lost another $2.2 million at the same casino.</p>
<p>Gamblers typically lose money in the short-term, but Mickelson’s losses are particularly staggering given his net worth of roughly $375 million.</p>
<p>So why did Mickelson risk so much money at the casino? Some have speculated that he may have been trying to cover losses from earlier in the year. In March, he lost a reported $1 million playing high-stakes poker games with Rick Salomon and actor Tobey Maguire.</p>
<p>Mickelson is far from the only celebrity to suffer major losses at the casino. Last year, singer Wayne Newton lost $3 million in one night, and actor Nicholas Cage reportedly blew through $17 million in 2002.</p>
<p>Casinos love when big spenders like Mickelson come through their doors, but even they must be scratching their heads over his recent losses.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Tumbles-Down-the-Leaderboard-After-Major-Gambling-Loss"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Tumbles-Down-the-Leaderboard-After-Major-Gambling-Loss" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Tumbles Down the Leaderboard After Major Gambling Loss"></a>Phil Mickelson Tumbles Down the Leaderboard After Major Gambling Loss</h1><p>Phil Mickelson has seen better days on the golf course. The 48-year-old golfer, who is a five-time major champion, tumbled down the leaderboard at the Quicken Loans National after admitting to losing nearly $1 million in a high-stakes gambling session.</p>
<p>“I made a bad decision and I did not play my best,” Mickelson said of his performance at the event. “It was unfortunate, but I will learn from it and move on.”</p>
<p>According to reports, Mickelson lost close to $1 million in a single day of gambling at a casino in Las Vegas. The exact details of the wager are unknown, but it is believed that Mickelson was playing against professional poker players.</p>
<p>The loss comes just one week after Mickelson announced that he was taking a break from competitive golf to focus on his family and personal affairs. It’s unclear if the gambling loss played any role in Mickelson’s decision to take time off from golf, but it’s certainly not good news for the veteran golfer.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Mickelson has been involved in a high-stakes gambling session. In 2009, he was caught up in an illegal gambling ring that resulted in him paying a $920,000 fine.</p>
<p>Mickelson is one of the most successful golfers in history, but his recent gambling losses could put a damper on his career. He will have a chance to redeem himself later this year when he competes in the PGA Championship and U.S. Open.</p>
